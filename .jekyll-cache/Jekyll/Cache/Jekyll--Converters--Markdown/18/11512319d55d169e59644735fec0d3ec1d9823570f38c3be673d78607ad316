I"@<p>These are some scattered notes on how to write effective flashcards.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prompts should be built iteratively, revised over time, and connected with other concepts</li>
  <li>Learning to write good prompts is like learning to write good sentences. Each of these skills sometimes seems trivial, but each can be developed to a virtuosic level.</li>
  <li>If you find yourself reviewing something you don’t care about anymore, you should act</li>
  <li>Another way to approach this advice is to think about its reverse: what material <em>should</em> you write prompts about? When are these systems worth using?</li>
  <li>The best way to begin is to use these systems to help you do something that really matters to you—for example, as a lever to more deeply understand ideas connected to your core creative work</li>
  <li>Prompts are good for knowing stuff as you’re building things</li>
  <li>Think of knowing syntax while coding. They stay with you over time as you use it.</li>
  <li>Prompts can trigger other ideas and prompt you to dig into deeper subjects.</li>
  <li>Good prompts start from ideas and can be connected to knowledge graphs.</li>
  <li>You can use prompts to memorize quotes and poems you enjoy</li>
  <li>You can add more content to each card besides the answer (e.g., images)</li>
  <li>10 simple cards easily remembered &gt; 1 complex card</li>
  <li>The longer the time you need to remember knowledge, the more you benefit from simplifying your items</li>
  <li>We want a minimum amount of information to be retrieved from memory in a single repetition! <strong>We want answer to be as short as imaginably possible</strong></li>
  <li>Well-employed images will greatly reduce your learning time in areas such as anatomy, geography, geometry, chemistry, history, and many more</li>
  <li>Use mnemonic techniques (e.g., FACE acronym for notes in  the piano)</li>
  <li>Avoid sets (e.g., list of items you need to remember)</li>
  <li>Use reference labels to simplify knowledge (Title, Author, etc)</li>
  <li>Prioritize knowledge, learn the basics first and build upon it</li>
  <li>Add sources to your cards; use reliable sources</li>
</ul>

  <li>Q: What are the characteristics of the Dead Sea?</li>
  <li>A: Salt lake located on the border between Israel and Jordan. Its shoreline is the lowest point on the Earth’s surface, averaging 396 m below sea level. It is 74 km long. It is seven times as salty (30% by volume) as the ocean. Its density keeps swimmers afloat. Only simple organisms can live in its saline waters</li>
