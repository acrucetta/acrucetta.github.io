I"¸<p>There‚Äôs no mythical person that knows everything you don‚Äôt.</p>

<p>Impostor syndrome can happen when we think we we‚Äôre not good enough to do a job. We think everyone around us is smarter, faster, more connected. This prevent us from moving ahead, we paralyze and decide not to do anything because it‚Äôs not worth it.</p>

<p>It can happen when you first try to learn something, you research what to learn and become overwhelmed by the sheer amount of things to know. Try to learn about Deep Learning? There‚Äôs over 15 good books you ‚Äúmust‚Äù read. Try to learn how to program? Too late, you‚Äôre too old, or too slow, or there‚Äôs thousands of other people that are already doing it, why try.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve found the key to push through is to embrace ‚Äúimperfectionism‚Äù and to cultivate joy and interest in what you do.</p>

<p>Imperfectionism means that your life is finite, you won‚Äôt be able to do everything you want. You won‚Äôt read all the books or know everything about a subject. Ironically, that same thought means you can learn <em>something</em>, maybe a book or two that you find interesting. You won‚Äôt learn everything but you can start somewhere.</p>

<p>Cultivating joy and interest means pulling a thread of some topic you‚Äôre curious about. Then taking a step towards it. Once you‚Äôre a few steps in, you learn more about the subject. Maybe you want to learn how to program, you build a small Tetris app, then you explore how to use CSS and HTML. Slowly you build confidence in a narrow domain. That confidence can trickle down to other areas.</p>

<p>I found helpful John Carmack‚Äôs commencement speech on the value of believing you can learn anything you want.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are lots of viable paths through engineering. The path that I advocate for is knowledge in depth‚Äîfor knowing things really deeply. It‚Äôs possible that I‚Äôm a little bit of a dinosaur here, and this might even be suboptimal advice to listen to. Listen, I mean, it‚Äôs true that the modern wizardry of building amazing applications by bashing together a bunch of JavaScript libraries and web services has indeed minted a lot of startup millionaires. But it does remind me of Mickey Mouse as The Sorcerer‚Äôs Apprentice in Fantasia, animating broomsticks with magic that he doesn‚Äôt really understand and eventually making a really big mess.</p>

  <p>So knowing how to pull the lever of power is rewarding, but there‚Äôs a satisfaction in really understanding how they work and knowing things very deeply. There‚Äôs also a great confidence you can have when you know that you could build something from scratch, even if you choose not to. Almost everything that we work with has really great depths to explore. <strong>You can‚Äôt know everything, but you should look at this as you can know anything‚Äîanything that you turn your attention to that you choose to focus on. You can understand. Nothing is magic, and you can tear things apart if you need to to find the details.</strong></p>
