<blockquote>
  <p>Hamming emphasizes focusing on foundational concepts rather than transient
technological details. He believes that mastering fundamental principles
enables computer scientists to adapt to new technologies and solve novel
problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He argues that a strong grasp of mathematical concepts, particularly in areas
like discrete mathematics, linear algebra, and probability, is essential for
deep understanding and innovation in the field.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What you did to become successful is likely to become counterproductive when
applied at a later date.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When you are stuck, often the solution is to go back to fundamentals and ask yourself, ‘What is really going on here?’”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The purpose of education is not to fill your mind with facts, but to teach you how to think. Facts come and go, but thinking goes on forever.”</p>
