    I'm a Software Engineer with a MS in Computer Science and Public Policy from
    the University of Chicago with 3+ years of experience. I'm currently a Back
    End Engineer at Waltz Health, we're building a platform to help people save
    money with their prescriptions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm passionate about the intersection of machine learning, software
    engineering, and social impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the past, I started a company called
    <a href="https://www.ctrl.golf/">CTRL.golf</a> to help golfers improve their
    club swing with machine learning. I also worked as a consultant for
    healthcare companies with Strategy& (part of PwC). More recently, I worked
    at Facebook (now Meta) as a Product Growth Intern and interned at Shelf
    Engine as a Data Scientist.
