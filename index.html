    Hey, I'm Andrés!
  </h1>
  <p>
    I am a Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience and a 
    MS in Computer Science and Public Policy from the University of Chicago. 
    I am currently a Back End Engineer at <a href="https://www.waltzhealth.com/">Waltz Health</a>, where I work on a 
    platform to help people save money with their prescriptions. 
  </p>
    I'm interested in data platforms, machine learning, and statistics.  
  </>
  <p>
    After college, I started a company called
    <a href="https://www.ctrl.golf/">CTRL.golf</a> to help golfers improve their
    club swing with machine learning. I was part of the founding team and helped
    get the product acquire funding from the National Science Foundation. 
  </p>
  <p>
    During graduate school, I worked at a few tech companies including Shelf Engine (data science)
    and Facebook's Privacy team (product growth).
