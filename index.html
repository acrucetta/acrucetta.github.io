  <h1>Hey, I'm Andr√©s! <span class="emoji wave" role="img" aria-label="hand wave"></span></h1>
  <p>
    I'm a grad student at UChicago in Computer Science and Public Policy. I'm also working part-time
    as a data scientist at <a href="https://www.shelfengine.com/">Shelf Engine</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm passionate about the intersection of machine learning, policy, and social impact.

  <p>
    Before this, I started a company called <a href="https://www.ctrl.golf/">CTRL.golf</a> and worked
    as a consultant for healthcare companies with Strategy& (part of PwC). I also got to work this
    past 2021 summer at Facebook (now Meta) as a Product Growth Intern.
