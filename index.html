  <h1>Hey, I'm Andr√©s! <span class="emoji wave" role="img" aria-label="hand wave"></span></h1>
  <p>
    I'm a Software Engineer with a MS in Computer Science and Public Policy from the University of Chicago with 3+ years
    of experience. 
  <p>
    I'm passionate about the intersection of machine learning, software engineering, and social impact.

    In the past, I started a company called <a href="https://www.ctrl.golf/">CTRL.golf</a> to help golfers
    improve their club swing with machine learning. I also worked as a consultant for healthcare companies with 
    Strategy& (part of PwC). More recently, I worked at Facebook (now Meta) as a Product Growth Intern and 
    interned at Shelf Engine as a Data Scientist.
