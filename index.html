    I'm a Software Engineer with a MS in Computer Science and Public Policy from the University of Chicago with 3+ years
    of experience. I'm currently a Back End Engineer at Waltz Health, we're building a platform to help people save money
    with their prescriptions. 
  <p>
    I'm passionate about the intersection of machine learning, software engineering, and social impact.

    In the past, I started a company called <a href="https://www.ctrl.golf/">CTRL.golf</a> to help golfers
    improve their club swing with machine learning. I also worked as a consultant for healthcare companies with 
    Strategy& (part of PwC). More recently, I worked at Facebook (now Meta) as a Product Growth Intern and 
    interned at Shelf Engine as a Data Scientist.
