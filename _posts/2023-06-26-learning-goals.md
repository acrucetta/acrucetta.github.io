- [] Memory Management: The "Memory" chapter in "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces" offers a beginner-friendly guide.
- [] File Systems: The Khan Academy course on "Memory and Storage" includes a segment on file systems.
- [] Device Management: It might be slightly harder to find approachable resources on this topic. However, "Computer Science: An Overview" by Glenn Brookshear and Dennis Brylow gives a good introduction.

- [] Operating System Design and Implementation: The online book "Operating Systems: From 0 to 1" again provides a good starting point.
- [] Case Studies: "The Design of the UNIX Operating System" by Maurice J. Bach is a classic text. It's a bit older, but it can give you a solid understanding of a historically important OS.

## How I (should) approach learning a subject

## Mnemonic before starting the day

### F - Frame Your Day
Create a to-do list of tasks to accomplish. Prioritize them based on urgency and importance.
Schedule specific times for each task to ensure you have a structured plan for the day.

###O - Organize Your Space

Ensure your workspace is clean and free of potential visual distractions.
Make sure the noise level in your workspace is manageable. If not, consider using noise-cancelling headphones or a white noise machine.

### C - Control Digital Distractions

Turn off non-essential notifications on your devices.
Set aside designated times for checking emails and social media rather than allowing constant interruptions.
Use apps or browser extensions that limit access to distracting websites or apps during your focus periods.

### U - Understand Your Energy Levels

Schedule your most important or difficult tasks during your peak energy periods.
Take regular breaks torefresh and recharge. Consider using techniques like the Pomodoro method.

### S - Set Boundaries
Inform others (colleagues, family, friends) about your focus hours to minimize interruptions.
Establish and stick to your boundaries for work-life balance. Don't allow your work to encroach on your personal time and vice versa.
