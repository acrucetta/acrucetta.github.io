# Capturing Your Fleeting Thoughts: Introducing `hmm`

Github: [https://github.com/acrucetta/thought-capturer](https://github.com/acrucetta/thought-capturer)

Have you ever been struck with a brilliant idea, only to forget it moments later because you didn't write it down? Or found yourself with dozens of post-it notes scattered around your desk, each with a different thought or reminder? If so, you're not alone. It can be challenging to keep track of all the thoughts and ideas that float in and out of our minds on a daily basis.

That's where `hmm` comes in. `hmm` is a simple CLI tool written in Rust that allows you to capture your thoughts and ideas right from your terminal. With `hmm`, you can quickly jot down a new thought, list all your existing ones, remove ones you don't need anymore, and even clear everything out when you're done. And because `hmm` saves everything to a CSV file, you can easily export and share your thoughts with others.

But why is it so important to capture your thoughts in the first place? Here are just a few reasons:

## 1. Thoughts are fleeting

We've all had the experience of coming up with a great idea, only to forget it moments later. By capturing your thoughts as soon as they come to you, you can ensure that you don't lose them in the noise of daily life.

## 2. Capturing your thoughts can reduce stress

When you have a lot on your mind, it can be overwhelming and stressful. Capturing your thoughts can help you organize them and make sense of them, reducing stress and helping you feel more in control.

## 3. Your thoughts are valuable

Your thoughts and ideas are unique to you, and they have the potential to change the world. By capturing and organizing them, you can ensure that you don't forget the important ones, and you can easily refer back to them when you need to.

So what are you waiting for? Install `hmm` today and start capturing your thoughts in a way that works for you. Who knows what brilliant ideas you'll come up with next!
