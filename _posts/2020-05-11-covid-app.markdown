## About the project

This project was born out of my desire to track Chicago's re-opening stages. In April, the city released an opening plan with five phases that detailed the specific metrics Chicago needed to meet to proceed to the next stage.

I've developed a dashboard with Flask, Plotly, and Python that captures data from the Chicago Open Data project and outputs the current state for the city in a simple way.

The four charts I've selected are:
- Daily New Cases
- Daily New Deaths
- COVID Patients in ICU Beds
- COVID Patients in Ventilator

After these graphs, I've outlined a list of the reopening stages from Stay at Home (Phase 1), to Reopening the City (Phase 5)
