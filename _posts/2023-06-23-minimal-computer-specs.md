I'm going to be building a computer based on the 50 year old computer 
concept. The ideal is for it to have an e-ink reader with a 
Rasperry Pi powering it. It will run Plan 9 as the operating
system and be used mostly for writing and editing.

Bill of materials:
- Rasperry Pi 3B+ (~$70)
- E-ink screen / Arduino screen 7" (~$70)
- Mechanical keyboard ($50-60)
- Wooden case (???)

Sub-total: $210-220
