_“Joe, you look like you’re flawless! You seem to just wake up at 4:30AM and run a half-marathon”_

As Joe shyly dodged the comment from his co-worker at the banking firm, he felt mixed emotions. If he knew all of his stories, he wouldn’t say that. Yes, he looked happy and joyful but he also had deep-seated anxiety that sometimes haunted him.

_Am I doing all of these things for a reason? Am I escaping from something?_

This happened every time he met someone new that didn’t seem to know him. Joe’s first appearance was of being “flawless”, doing all the right things such as going to college, joining the right organizations, and then joining a prestigious job. He never really stopped to ask himself the deep questions. _What has he doing them for? Was he truly doing something close to his heart or was he just doing what he was supposed to do?_

Joe was born in Boston, growing up in the city, he went to the most prestigious high school in the city under pressure from his parents. After joining, he promptly integrated into the clubs that would put him closer to the next logical step — a prestigious university. He joined the chess club, debate team, and the school’s basketball team. He didn’t really enjoy any of these, the last fond memory he had of doing an activity for the sake of it was when he attended a theatre class in middle school. For once he felt free and able to express himself, maybe it’s because he was being someone else.

He dashed through high school with all of the accolades. You name it. Valedictorian, lead in the basketball team, and competitive chess player. When it came to college applications, he knew that it would be “_Ivy or Bust_” his parents had a legacy to preserve after all.

Going through job applications was a breeze. With the help of his parents, he got into the Economics department at Brown University. Its limestone buildings made him feel like in a fairytale, to almost forget what was his main purpose for college — _to position himself for success_ — as his parents would often say.

Semesters flew by while in college, he joined the consulting club, investment banking club, and took the right classes — excel modeling and financial derivatives — to prepare him for a successful career at a top tier banking firm.

Joe also took the right internships. He got to intern at a top tier investment bank in New York thanks to his family connections. He didn’t love the work itself but it paid well, and the _exit opportunities_ — as his colleagues called them — would be stellar.

_Exit opportunities? he thought, why would someone join a career track with the prospect of leaving it?_

But if everyone’s taking this track, then there must be something to it. After all, why would thousands of smart people fly to Wall Street and major cities summer after summer if there wasn’t a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow?

Sure enough. After spending time at the top investment bank in Wall Street for a summer, Joe felt like he found his path. Smart people, great pay, and great perks. What else would a young professional want early on in his career?

Still, he felt many of the people he worked with were constantly scheming these _exit strategies_. Was it just the internship that seemed rosy, or was there something he didn’t fully capture during his summer stint.

He also felt a profound sense of loneliness during his internship. Yes, he was surrounded by smart people and they would frequently get drinks and go out in the fancy NYC restaurants and nightclubs in the meatpacking district. However, it seemed to end at that.

Joe remembered from his Intro to Psychology classes that it is not enough to be surrounded by people to not feel lonely — you can be in the middle of Times Square and feel alone. It is also influenced by the quality of those relationships — do people care about you? who would you call when you’re stricken by a flue in the middle of the night.

Despite his mixed feelings during his time in NYC, Joe felt like this was the right path. He knew he had to push forward. _Position yourself for success_ would ring on his head, every time he doubted his path.

_But what is success? Is it his father’s perception of a good career?_

Coming back to college after his internship Joe felt like he was _the_ man on campus. He managed to finish his undergraduate degree with stellar grades, doubling down on his investment banking club by becoming the treasurer of the club and accepting the full-time offer to join the investment bank in Wall Street.

As soon as Joe graduated from college he took a trip to Japan. He found the calm and collected manner of the Japanese to be captivating. He was first struck by how the staff at the Tokyo train station worked with so much care and presence.

_If they’re doing “menial” work, how could they motivate themselves to get up in the morning and work with so much care? he thought to himself_

In his hostel in Tokyo, he noticed how many of the other European backpackers he met didn’t have much context of what investment banks were or how to get on a _path to success._ Every time he started mentioning his path to ascend to Private Equity and then take on a C-Suite position their eyes seemed to fade into the distance and become disinterested.

For all they knew, traveling to Japan wasn’t an escape or a retirement before years of toil whenever they returned home but a way to explore themselves and new cultures. Whenever they returned they’d find a job related to their college degree, but it wasn’t top of mind.

For Joe, this seemed outrageous. How can you not do a 12 month, 3 years, or 5-year projection of your goals, with weekly tasks and accountability partners? How could success come to you otherwise? If you’re not pressing against challenges and doing everything it takes to move obstacles out of the way in your path to the top of the corporate mountain.

He had other things to think of during this trip, he’d find plenty of time back home to worry about this once he returned to New York City.

Weeks in Japan with his European friends renewed Joe in a way that he didn’t expect. They pressed him, for once, not to have a to-do list. He would just _wander_ around town and _surrender_ to whatever experience would come his way.

During his unplanned walks in Tokyo, he would often meet new people in the fish markets and stumble upon craft stores that exposed him to the pride of craftsmanship within Japanese culture.

Joe felt his heart wrenching as he said goodbye to his European friends who would later continue their trek to Australia. He wondered whether there was something to the way they thought. They seemed less anxious than his co-workers back in NYC, they also didn’t seem to be in the constant sense of hurry he felt while working in the bank that previous summer.

Maybe there’s an alternative to the non-stop waking-up at 4:30 am hustle.

As Joe boarded the flight back to NYC, he had mixed emotions, on one hand, he felt a deep-seated calm from not having an agenda, on the other hand, he had an inner urge to strive, to achieve, and to _position himself for success_.

_How could he bridge these two feelings?_

_Striving and self-acceptance?_

_Are they completely opposite, or would there be a way to live with seemingly paradoxical emotions?_

Once Joe landed in NYC, he settled into his Park Avenue studio, just blocks away from his office. Entering into his building, his soon-to-be coworkers were talking about their 10 days/ 10 cities marathon in Europe and how they checked every major landmark off the list. He was first struck by this go-getter approach to “tourism”, then he realized he also thought that way.

_As Joe approached his new work, something within him started to simmer down. Was it his ambition? or was he discovering a truth that some would go on to discover years after working for long hours._
