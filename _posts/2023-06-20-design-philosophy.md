following the example of https://j3s.sh/ I wanted to write some notes
on what things I want to drive my design

simplicity

- not too much clutter
- one use, and do it well
- uses UNIX commands when possible

maintainable

- i understand how it works
- i can add new features

fast

- not too many dependencies
- from the CLi ideally, if not plain text

reliable

- not too many features
- focused on one task

aesthetic

- plain text or markdown
- no pictures
- easy to read and focus
- as little javascript as possible

some tools I've build based on this philosophy are:

- hmm - capture thoughts from the terminal
- task - capture tasks from the terminal
- looker - look for documents in my folders with index
