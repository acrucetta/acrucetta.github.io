A project I've been thinking about is biking across the U.S. It seems like there are routes in the U.S. you can take by railroad.

I liked Kevin Kelly's quote of having a good rest ethic to have a good work ethic. Also on the importance of having a Sabbatical.

I'm going to start compiling some resources here. 

My project is to bike across the Pacific Coast.
