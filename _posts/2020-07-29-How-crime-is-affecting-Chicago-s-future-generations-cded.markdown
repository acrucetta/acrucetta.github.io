Crime in Chicago has been an issue from the Chicago Outfit era to now widespread shootings across neighborhoods. NBC Chicago reported over 424 shootings in June 2020 across the city. Controlling these crimes has become a national topic with President Donald Trump clashing against current mayor Lori Lightfoot over whether or not to use the fed force to restrain it.¹

There’s much to say about the crime in Chicago, however, one thing that’s not often spoken is how it affects its children and future generation. Through a quantitative approach, I’m going to explore which are the neighborhoods most in need of social programs across the city.

### **How des crime affect children?**

Growing up in Maracaibo, Venezuela, I’ve been exposed to a rampant crime scene mostly driven by petty crime such as car theft. I didn’t fully grasp how it affected the upbringing of my friends in school who lived in more dangerous neighborhoods. That is until I recently discovered the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) research.²

The definition of ACEs is _traumatic events occurring before age 18. ACEs include all types of abuse and neglect as well as parental mental illness, substance use, divorce, incarceration, and domestic violence.³_

Studies have found a clear relationship between the number of ACEs a person experiences and the negative outcomes in their adulthood, including poor physical and mental health, substance abuse, and risky behaviors.

That is, the more ACEs you experience, the more risk you have to commit a crime or end up using drugs as a way of coping with issues in your life.

To figure out how many ACEs children experience in the city of Chicago I broke down the city across community areas and used data from the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) to quantify the levels of crime and abuse in the city.⁴

#### **Crimes in Chicago in 2019**

Crime in Chicago follows a seasonal pattern, with the peak crime levels happening in the Summer, when most people are out, and lowering in the winter, when temperatures of -10 F and winds over 30 MPH keep people at home.

When there are words in the news that crime is reaching “alarming” or “very high” levels it is easy to forget that, the crime itself, may not be getting worse but we may be in a season when more people are out in the street looking for a quick opportunity.

**Crime in Chicago occurs predominantly in three clusters:**

**Downtown #1:** Near North Side and Loop with about ~12K crimes per year and ~10K crimes per year respectively.

**West Chicago #2:** Austin, one of the west suburban neighborhoods in Chicago with about ~14K crimes reported in 2019.

**South Side #3:** Southside neighborhoods including Chatham, Auburn Gresham, and Englewood with approximately 6K crimes per year on each neighborhood.

#### _Crimes in Chicago related to Substance Abuse_

Research shows that the use of alcohol, or illicit drugs can have a bad effect on the child’s development. When a woman takes a drug, the substance passes through the placenta and easily reaches the baby in the fetus. Studies suggest that about 5% of pregnant women use one or more addictive substances.⁵

Communities in Chicago with high use of narcotic crimes can also inform which areas need more neonatal services to prevent Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) in which the baby goes through withdrawal during birth.⁵

The leading community areas in Chicago for narcotic rimes are North Lawndale with 2,000 crimes per year, Humboldt Park with 1,750, and West Garfield Park with 1,600. They compose the narcotic crime hot spot in the city.

Amongst these communities, heroin possession composes the majority of the crimes with approximately 2,600 crimes per year, followed by Crack possession with 1,500, and cannabis possession of 30 mg. or less with 1,250 of the crimes.\*

\*_For 2020, Cannabis crimes, including possession and delivery will most likely go down as the city of Chicago approved its recreational use_

#### Crimes in Chicago related to Child Abuse

Child abuse (or neglect) during early childhood and teen years can cause harmful effects in their brain and cognitive development. According to childwelfare.gov childhood maltreatment has been linked to a higher risk for diabetes, lung disease, and heart attacks. It can also impact the way they cope with emotions by impacting their amygdala and hippocampus (key to learning and memory).

The most shocking effect comes from “Epigenetics”, which means that if a child has been maltreated, these changes can impact his or her genetic make-up and translate to his children. That is, if a 10-year-old kid in Humboldt Park is abused, whenever he or she has children, they will have a higher propensity to abuse their children. Creating a downward spiraling effect.

Having a child under the right circumstances can mean whether the baby can become a financial strain on an already cash-strapped family. Based on Chicago’s public health indicators, there’s a strong correlation of teen birth rate within the community area and the amount of child abuse or neglect.

In a study of over 3,000 girls, the Guttmacher Institute found that teenagers who were sexually abused were 3.1 times more likely to become pregnant and less likely to have used birth control in their last intercourse.⁶

This is confirmed by our data from Chicago where communities with over 60 teens pregnant between the ages 15–19 (per 1,000 females) showed an average of 125 child-related crimes compared with 50 for communities with rates lower than 40 teens.

#### Crimes in Chicago related to Domestic Violence

According to a survey by the CDC. 31% of women will experience physical violence by an intimate partner during their lifetime, while 47% will experience some sort of psychological aggression. One out of two women, even people you know and interact daily can be living this right now.⁸

Many of these women — after being abused — can end up using substances as a way to cope with the traumatic effect of abuse. Some could even be coerced to do so by an abusive partner.

As discussed previously, domestic abuse and child abuse go hand in hand. One way to prevent this is by breaking the loop and seeking help from the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1–800–799–7233).

Within the city of Chicago, the number one hub for domestic abuse is the Austin community area with over 1,750 crimes reported in 2019. It is also the top 4 community area in terms of domestic abuse with 1,250 crimes reported for that same year.

### **What is the city doing about it?**

Simply removing a child from a dangerous environment is not enough for the stress to go away. It is also important for the city to create social programs that stop the downward spirals within communities.

#### Family and Support Services Agencies

One of Chicago’s main programs is the Family and Support Services Agencies. Their mission is to _“connect Chicago residents and families to resources that build stability, support their well-being, and empower them to thrive.”_

The most common of this type of service is the [Early Head Start](https://www.theounce.org/what-we-do/programs/early-head-start-head-start/) program which gives children from at-risk backgrounds the skills they need to be successful in school and life-supporting more kids, families, and communities on their path to success.

Family engagement with early education is crucial for a child’s development, particularly for low-income families. An engaged family and supporting teachers help creasy consistency amongst school and home. Children with a strong foundation see the benefits in their grades and their friend group.

After examining their data for preventive programs, there’s a clear gap in where these services are located, perhaps contributing to the perpetuating downward spiral within communities such as West Englewood and Englewood.

The community with the most amount of services is Uptown Park with 50 delegate agencies, followed by Near West Side, and coming in third and fourth place are Austin and Humboldt Park.

#### Early learning programs for children

The next major community service in Chicago is [Chicago Early Learning](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/chicagoearlylearning/home/programs.html). These programs provide “quality early learning to all families, no matter their need”

Early Learning programs include ages 0–5, which according to the Children’s Bureau are amongst the most crucial stages for a child’s physical and cognitive development. Studies show that when a child experiences neglect at such an early age, it often manifests in deep-rooted issues that stay with them throughout the child’s life. They go on to develop low self-esteem, depression and lack a sense of belonging.

These programs prove to be better-targeted tat the communities that need it the most. The majority of the programs reside in Humboldt Park, North Lawndale, and Austin. Communities that suffer the majority of child abuse and domestic violence across the city.

### What comes next?

Crime in Chicago is skewed towards lower-income communities, many of them suffering cases of substance abuse, teen pregnancy, and domestic abuse. To prevent the downward spiraling of a child repeating his parent’s action the city must focus on early childhood development.

**Key questions for public health officials in the city are:**

1.  How are we targeting the right neighborhoods with the right social programs?
2.  How do we know these programs are reaching people once they’re established in a neighborhood?
3.  Are we providing enough family support services to those families in need? If not, what does that look like?
