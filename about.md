# About Me

I grew up in Venezuela and am now living in Chicago, IL.  

I'm interested in the intersection between policy and technology. I've written articles related to this in [Medium](https://medium.com/weekly-acumen) and have done several projects you can check-out on [GitHub.](https://github.com/acrucetta?tab=repositories)  

In my free time, I enjoy cooking Italian food, playing the piano, playing tennis, and cycling.
