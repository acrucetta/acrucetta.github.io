I grew up in Venezuela and am now living in Chicago, IL.  

I'm currently a candidate for the Masters in Computational Analysis for Public Policy (MSCAPP) at the University of Chicago. 

I'm interested in the intersection between policy and technology. I've written articles related to this in [Medium](https://medium.com/weekly-acumen) and have done several projects you can check-out on [GitHub.](https://github.com/acrucetta?tab=repositories)  

Before my masters I worked at PwC helping hospitals run more efficiently with analytics and automation, and founded a wearable tech start-up - CTRL.golf - to help golf players find their perfect swing with the help of a golf sleeve.  

In my free time, I enjoy cooking Italian food, playing the piano, playing tennis, and cycling.
