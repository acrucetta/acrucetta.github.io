<p>Welcome!, Iâ€™m Andres Crucetta, I grew up in Venezuela and am now living in Chicago, IL. 
	<br>
	<br> I'm currently a candidate for the Masters in Computational Analysis for Public Policy (MSCAPP) at the University of Chicago. I'm interested in using technology as a tool of social change and to help governments deliver services more effectively. I've written articles related to this in <a href="https://medium.com/weekly-acumen">Medium</a> and analyzed cities' open data through different projects in <a href="https://github.com/acrucetta?tab=repositories">GitHub.</a>.
	<br>
	<br> Before this I worked at PwC helping hospitals run more efficiently with analytics and automation, and founded a wearable tech start-up - CTRL.golf - to help golf players find their perfect swing with the help of a golf sleeve. 
	<br>
	<br> In my free time, I enjoy cooking Italian food, playing the piano, playing tennis, and cycling.
