What is the value of doing things yourself vs. using Chat GPT to think for you

Deepen the everest analogy; train for the climb vs having it take you all the way there.

Outline:

I've found in the last year using Chat GPT that I've been able to increase my productivity levels coding.

The tricky thing is I don't know if it has made me a better programmer.

We need to ask what are the things worth remembering vs. what can be oursourced to Copilot.

Is it worth remembering libraries? Vs. is it worht remembering what specific things do and how to use them.

The first one maybe not; the second one; struggling with methods and tools to handle data can be a good learning opportunity.

Tab tabbing doesn't lead to mastery. The same way writing with Chat GPT outsources your thinking and doesn't let you OWN the knowledge. Outsourcing your coding can lead you to oursource the logic and doesn't let you OWN the program and the bugs it might cause. 

At some points I've introduced logic or bugs that I get how they work at a high level but it would take me longer to debug.

As a beginner programmer; I wonder if it hinders you more than it helps you using Copilot to learn how to program. 

E.g., Learning O'Caml and using Copilot. Copilot didn't support the intricasies behind Jane Street's core libraries or the O'Caml stdlib. With Rust; it led to more fights with the compiler. With Python it was more useful. Maybe it depends on how niche is the language you're using. It might be good for high level projects but breaks in the details.

My own solution is if I'm learning a new language or coding a problem; force myself to think through the logic. Then use Copilot to help me nail down the methods if I'm using a specific library or doing a repetitive task.
