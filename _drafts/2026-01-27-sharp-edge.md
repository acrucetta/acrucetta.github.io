Sharp Edge vs. Dull Edge

As AI becomes more and more helpful, it can become an exoskeleton, we take it off, we're useless. Our brain wants to save energy, as with the GPS, once we stopped needing to know how to get places, we stopped caring about knowing directions by heart.

The same with AI. We're outsourcing our thinking in many ways. At work, with travel, writing, etc... it's a great tool, but we need to know what things matter to know, which ones we don't care about.

As Amish evaluate technologies before adopting them, we can figure out what is benefitting us. What technologies we want to be at the sharp edge vs. at the dull edge.

An if we're using AI, for what uses do we want to leverage it. Bearing in mind, whatever brain function we start outsourcing will get atrophied.
As for myself, here are things I want to be at the dull edge with AI
- things I have to answer for at work
- design decisions
- relationships and life decisions
- writings to friends / colleagues

At the sharp edge:
- answering code base questions
- quick analysis of data
- cicd
- ...
