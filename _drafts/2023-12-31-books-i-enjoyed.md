I wanted to take the time this year and write a list of the books that influenced me the most this year with a quick summary of what I learned from each one.

My goal this year was to read more fiction books, particularly science fiction. I started with a book series that was highly recommended: The Three Body Problem. 

Non-Fiction
- An Elegant Puzzle by Will Larson: 
- Writing and Interpreter / Compiler in Go:
- Elon Musk by Walter Isaacson:
- Die with Zero by Bill Perkins:
- How to Know a Person by David Brooks:

Fiction:
- The Three Body Problem (Volumes 1-3):
- Dune 1 and Dune Messiah:
- Brothers Karamazov (50% done):
