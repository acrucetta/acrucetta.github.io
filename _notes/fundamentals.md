### Richard Hamming on Fundamentals

> Hamming emphasizes focusing on foundational concepts rather than transient
> technological details. He believes that mastering fundamental principles
> enables computer scientists to adapt to new technologies and solve novel
> problems.

> He argues that a strong grasp of mathematical concepts, particularly in areas
> like discrete mathematics, linear algebra, and probability, is essential for
> deep understanding and innovation in the field.

> "What you did to become successful is likely to become counterproductive when
> applied at a later date."

> "When you are stuck, often the solution is to go back to fundamentals and ask yourself, ‘What is really going on here?’"

> "The purpose of education is not to fill your mind with facts, but to teach you how to think. Facts come and go, but thinking goes on forever."
