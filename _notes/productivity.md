Assorted notes on productivity:
- Until you profile your time, you won't know where you spend it
	- "It is commonly accepted, verging on a cliche, that you have no idea where your program spends time until you actually profile it, but the corollary that you also don't know where you spend your time until you've measured it is not nearly as accepted."
- Once you work on the "right" things, there's an advantage in working on them fast (rapid feedback)
- After eating, your body moves its energy to digesting; if you need to perform, eat >2-3 hours before
- Coffee takes 30-60 min to affect you; time accordingly when you need it
