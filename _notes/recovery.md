Assorted notes on recovering from injuries
- Isometric exercises are better than eccentric/concentric to heal tendons
- Vitamin C + Gelatin 1 hour before rehab exercises can improve healing
- In stronger tendons, you may need to hold for 45s+ (ankles), in smaller tendons (hands) you can hold for 10s to make them stronger
	- A typical routine includes 10s on / 50s off, 10 min every 6 hours or 1/day (ideal for climbing)
